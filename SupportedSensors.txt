In order to use a sensor, copy the exact name from the list into the config.json as a sensors type attribute
E.g.:
"sensors": [
        {
            "name": "TestSensor",
	    "type": "DistanceSensor_GP2Y0A710K0F"
            "gpio_pins": [
                {
                    ...

The following sensors are supported by SensorMonitor:
